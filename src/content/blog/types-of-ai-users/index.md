It's now clear that to succeed in most jobs, you need to leverage AI. At minimum, AI provides efficiency gains and handles routine tasks. Whether you're in an entry-level service role or stepping into an executive position, AI has something to offer.

How you integrate AI into your work, however, varies dramatically—and that choice matters more than most people realize. I see three broad categories of AI users:

**The Non-User** - This person isn't necessarily opposed to AI or unaware of it. They just don't use it much, and when they do, it's for very simple tasks. They get minimal value from it because they're stuck in their existing workflows. Maybe they haven't taken the time to learn it. Maybe they've heard warnings about AI's dangers and decided it's not worth the risk. Either way, they're missing opportunities.

**The Power User** - This person understands AI's capabilities and limitations. They integrate it purposefully into their work, using it as a strategic tool rather than a novelty. They're thoughtful but not fearful—spending time learning what AI does well and where it falls short. They're not bleeding-edge early adopters, but they follow trends and adapt quickly. These are the 10x producers who've figured out how to amplify their output through effective AI collaboration.

**The Dependent User** - This person has built a business or career heavily reliant on AI-generated work they don't fully understand themselves. Think of someone with no software engineering background running a SaaS product built entirely by AI, or creating content they can't critically evaluate. This category might not fully exist yet—or perhaps it never will at scale—but the concept serves as a cautionary tale about losing agency and competence to your tools.

**The goal? Become a Power User.** This is the sweet spot where AI amplifies your capabilities without replacing your judgment or eroding your skills. In the near to long-term future, AI proficiency won't be optional for great work—it will be foundational. The question isn't whether to use AI, but how deliberately you'll master it.
