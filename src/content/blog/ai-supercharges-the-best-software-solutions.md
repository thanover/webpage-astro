In the realm of software solutions available to us as developers, I wonder if mass adoption of AI by software engineers means that the 'best' solution are much more likely to be utilized. The quotes around best because it may not be the the most preferred or optimal, but is instead the one that is most included in the data a model is trained on, or more recently tools build for the model.

If you contrast how code solutions are propagated prior to AI, it was basically through word of mouth, maybe what you were taught at school, or most likely what you found in a quick google search. But now you can so easily start something without know anything about it, and a AI will serve up that 'best' solution.

I'm not sure this is a good thing. Perhaps this is just another way of describing the feared slopifcation that many predict as the result of the widespread use of AI. Optimistically though, I hope it means that the most optimal solutions are more easily found, used and improved.
